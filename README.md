precious dotfiles!

## intro

Loved `KDE Plasma`, loved `i3`.
Why not combine them?
Well, that's what happened **here**.

I swapped around a lot, but a few [r/unixporn] links motivated me to try out a combination of `KDE` & `i3`, most notable:
* [KDE + i3 - A match made in heaven]
* [KDE + bspwm] (different window manager, but still)

I always loved tilting window managers. `KDE Plasma` and its corresponding window manager `kwin` is not bad, but I wanted to improve my productivity and use my screen estate more efficiently. While I could have done this too with a window tiler like [QuickTile] (see
[ArchWiki - List of applications#Window_tilers] for more), I preferred changing the window manager.

I am using [i3-gaps], there is also [i3-kde] which is supposed to work better with `KDE` due to some KDE related patches, but I haven't tried that (yet).

## setup

* Browser: `firefox`
* Compositor: `compton`
* Font: `tewi & Hack`
* Program launcher: `rofi`
* Text editor: `neovim`
* Terminal emulator: `urxvt`
* Shell: `bash`
* Window manager: `i3-gaps`

## special thanks

I would like to thank [mohabaks] for his incredible i3 config, which I modified slightly. Check out his post at reddit: [i3gaps-solarized].
